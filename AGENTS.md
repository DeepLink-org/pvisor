# Persisting Agent Instructions

## Default project scope

Unless the user explicitly asks otherwise, treat the following subsystems as
out of scope for analysis, planning, implementation, refactoring, testing, and
documentation work:

- TTAS and tiered tensor memory
- Search

Do not modify these subsystems, expand their APIs, fix their tests, or include
their failures in the acceptance criteria for an unrelated task. Prefer
targeted build, lint, and test commands over workspace-wide commands when a
workspace-wide command would pull them into scope.

This exclusion covers, in particular:

- TTAS and tiered-memory code
- `persisting/search/`, `crates/persisting-pchronicle/src/search/`, Search CLI
  surfaces, and their tests and docs

The default active scope is the Agent infrastructure centered on pVisor,
pPilot, pChronicle, Gateway, Control, OverlayFS, OverlayNet, and trajectory CLI
surfaces.

Enter an excluded subsystem only when:

1. the user explicitly names that subsystem in the current task; or
2. an in-scope change cannot be completed without a minimal dependency-boundary
   adjustment there.

For the second case, keep the adjustment minimal and explain why it is
required. Do not use incidental cleanup as a reason to broaden scope.

## Test command

Use `just test` as the default validation command. It runs Rust tests through
`cargo nextest` in debug mode (for faster iteration) and then runs the Python
test suite. To limit Rust coverage to one package, pass its Cargo package name
positionally, for example `just test persisting-agentctl`. The `pchronicle`
alias also runs `persisting-pchronicle-cli` (same as the CI pchronicle shard);
use `just test pchronicle-cli` for the CLI crate alone. Use a direct
`cargo test` invocation only when doctests or an explicitly documented special
runner is required.
