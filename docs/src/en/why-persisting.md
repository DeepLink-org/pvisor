# Why Persisting

Agent systems can produce useful work before they produce a useful record of
what happened. Persisting closes that gap.

## The problem

An Agent changes files, calls tools, reads data, and makes decisions across a
long-running session. A terminal transcript is too shallow to review safely;
an isolated sandbox without a durable record is hard to learn from; a raw event
log is difficult to query consistently.

Persisting treats a Run as one job with a reviewable record:

- **pVisor governs the Run.** It gives an Agent a staged workspace, records the
  controls that were actually active, and lets a person review Effects before
  applying them. Optional capture keeps the model traffic of that Run next to
  the Bundle.

## The product promise

Every workflow should make three things easy to answer:

1. What was the Agent allowed to do?
2. What actually changed or happened?
3. Which evidence and history support the answer?

Persisting does not claim that a successful command proves a perfect boundary.
It records the mechanisms, limitations, Effects, and evidence that were
actually available.

## When Persisting fits

Use Persisting when an Agent can change a real project, when a Run needs human
review before merge, or when the Run record should remain useful after the
terminal session ends. Start with pVisor.

If you only need a one-off script with no review or history requirement,
Persisting may be more infrastructure than the task needs.

## The design direction

Persisting is built around explicit boundaries, inspectable evidence, reversible
writes, and portable data. These principles guide the [system design](system-design/index.md)
and the current [roadmap](roadmap.md).
